# MEvsU

It’s said that when chased by a bear, you don’t need to outrun the bear; you just need to outrun your friend. Similarly, to win a championship, a promotion, or a date, you need only to beat the immediate competition, whether a team, a colleague, or a fellow suitor. Welcome to MeVsU, your ultimate competition website. Here you can create, participate and invite friends to compete. Let the best (wo)man win.

User Story
As a competitive person I want to create, compete and invite friends into competitions.
