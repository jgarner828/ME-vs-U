# MEvsU

It’s said that when chased by a bear, you don’t need to outrun the bear; you just need to outrun your friend. Similarly, to win a championship, a promotion, or a date, you need only to beat the immediate competition, whether a team, a colleague, or a fellow suitor. Welcome to MeVsU, your ultimate competition website. Here you can create, participate and invite friends to compete. Let the best (wo)man win.

User Story
As a competitive person I want to create, compete and invite friends into competitions.

Technologies Used
MeVsU is powered through HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and Node js

Directions for future development
login feature: User will be able to create an account to manage their MyAnime.com content. In addition, we would like to use Meetups API to connect our users and form a community.

Voting feature: Users can give a thumbs up or downvote anime content and create a "favorites" list.

When participants enter their email in the "Let's be Friends" section, they will automatically be enrolled in our monthly newsletter.
